#Demo 2.1 - Updating to a non-existent image. 
#Delete any current deployments, because we're interested in the deploy state changes.

#Create our v1 deployment, then update it to v2
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.v2.yaml


#Observe behavior since new image wasn’t available, the ReplicaSet doesn't go below maxUnavailable

#Why isn't this finishing...? after progressDeadlineSeconds which we set to 10 seconds (defaults to 10 minutes)
kubectl rollout status deployment hello-world


#Expect a return code of 1 from kubectl rollout status...that's how we know we're in the failed status.
echo $?


#Let's check out Pods, ImagePullBackoff/ErrImagePull...ah an error in our image definition.
#Also, it stopped the rollout at 5, that's kind of nice isn't it?
#And 8 are online, let's look at why.
kubectl get pods


#What is maxUnavailable? 25%...So only two Pods in the ORIGINAL ReplicaSet are offline and 8 are online.
#What is maxSurge? 25%? So we have 13 total Pods, or 25% in addition to Desired number.
#Look at Replicas and OldReplicaSet 8/8 and NewReplicaSet 5/5.
#  Available      True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
#  Progressing    False   ProgressDeadlineExceeded

#Let's sort this out now...check the rollout history, but which revision should we rollback to?
kubectl rollout history deployment hello-world


#It's easy in this example, but could be harder for complex systems.
#Let's look at our revision Annotation, should be 3
kubectl describe deployments hello-world | head

#We can also look at the changes applied in each revision to see the new pod templates.
kubectl rollout history deployment hello-world --revision=2
kubectl rollout history deployment hello-world --revision=3


#Let's undo our rollout to revision 2, which is our v2 container.

###Examine deployment.probes-1.yaml, review strategy settings, revisionhistory, and readinessProbe settings###

####QUICKLY run these two commands or as one block.####
#Demo 3 - Controlling the rate and update strategy of a Deployment update.
#Let's deploy a Deployment with Readiness Probes
kubectl apply -f deployment.probes-1.yaml --record


#Available is still 0 because of our Readiness Probe's initialDelaySeconds is 10 seconds.
#Also, look there's a new annotaion for our change-cause
#And check the Conditions, 
#   Progressing   True    NewReplicaSetCreated or ReplicaSetUpdated - depending on the state.
#   Available     False   MinimumReplicasUnavailable

#Check again, Replicas and Conditions. 
#Progressing is now ReplicaSetUpdated, will change to NewReplicaSetAvailable when it's Ready
#NewReplicaSet is THIS current RS, OldReplicaSet is populated during a Rollout, otherwise it's <None>
#We used the update strategy settings of max unavailable and max surge to slow this rollout down.
#This update takes about a minute to rollout

kubectl rollout status deployment hello-world


#Let's check the status of the Deployment, Replicas and Conditions, 
#22 total (20 original + 2 max surge)

#  Progressing    True    ReplicaSetUpdated 
kubectl describe deployment hello-world


#Let's look at our ReplicaSets, no Pods in the new RS 67844877b6 are READY, but 4 our deployed.
#That RS with Desired 0 is from our V1 deployment, 18 is from our V2 deployment.
kubectl get replicaset


#Ready...that sounds familiar, let's check the deployment again
#What keeps a pod from reporting ready? A Readiness Probe...see that Readiness Probe, wrong port ;)
kubectl describe deployment hello-world
 

#We can read the Deployment's rollout history, and see our CHANGE-CAUSE annotations
kubectl rollout history deployment hello-world


#Let's rollback to revision 2 to undo that change...
kubectl rollout history deployment hello-world --revision=3
kubectl rollout history deployment hello-world --revision=2

#And check out our deployment to see if we get 20 Ready replicas
kubectl describe deployment | head
kubectl get deployment

#Let's clean up
