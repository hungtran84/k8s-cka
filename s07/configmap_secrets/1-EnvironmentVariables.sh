#Demo 1 - Passing Configuration into Containers using Environment Variables
#Create two deployments, one for a database system and the other our application.
#I'm putting a little wait in there so the Pods are created one after the other.
kubectl apply -f deployment-alpha.yaml
sleep 5
kubectl apply -f deployment-beta.yaml


#Let's look at the services
kubectl get service


#Now let's get the name of one of our pods
PODNAME=$(kubectl get pods | grep hello-world-alpha | awk '{print $1}' | head -n 1)
echo $PODNAME


#Inside the Pod, let's read the enviroment variables from our container
#Notice the alpha information is there but not the beta information. Since beta wasn't defined when the Pod started.
kubectl exec -it $PODNAME -- /bin/sh 
printenv | sort
exit


#If you delete the pod and it gets recreated, you will get the variables for the alpha and beta service information.
kubectl delete pod $PODNAME


#Get the new pod name and check the environment variables...the variables are define at Pod/Container startup.
PODNAME=$(kubectl get pods | grep hello-world-alpha | awk '{print $1}' | head -n 1)
kubectl exec -it $PODNAME -- /bin/sh -c "printenv | sort"


#If we delete our serivce and deployment 
kubectl delete deployment hello-world-beta
kubectl delete service hello-world-beta


#The enviroment variables stick around...to get a new set, the pod needs to be recreated.
kubectl exec -it $PODNAME -- /bin/sh -c "printenv | sort"



#Let's clean up after our demo
kubectl delete -f deployment-alpha.yaml
