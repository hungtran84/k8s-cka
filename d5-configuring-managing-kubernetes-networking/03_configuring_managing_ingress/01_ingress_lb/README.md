## Deploying an ingress controller
- For our Ingress Controller, we're going to go with nginx, widely available and easy to use. 

```
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
```

- Using this manifest, the Ingress Controller is in the `ingress-nginx` namespace but it will monitor for Ingresses in all namespaces by default. If can be scoped to monitor a specific namespace if needed.

- Check the status of the pods to see if the ingress controller is online.
```
kubectl get pods --namespace ingress-nginx
```

- Now let's check to see if the service is online. This of type `LoadBalancer`, so do you have an EXTERNAL-IP?

```
kubectl get services --namespace ingress-nginx
```

- Check out the ingressclass nginx, we have not set the is-default-class so in each of our Ingresses we will need specify an ingressclassname
```
kubectl describe ingressclasses nginx
kubectl annotate ingressclasses nginx "ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true"
```

## Single Service
- Create a deployment, scale it to 2 replicas and expose it as a serivce. 
This service will be `ClusterIP` and we'll expose this service via the `Ingress`.

```
kubectl create deployment hello-world-service-single --image=ghcr.io/hungtran84/hello-app:1.0
kubectl scale deployment hello-world-service-single --replicas=2
kubectl expose deployment hello-world-service-single --port=80 --target-port=8080 --type=ClusterIP
```

- Create a single Ingress routing to the one backend service on the service port 80 listening on all hostnames

```
kubectl apply -f ingress-single.yaml
```

- Get the status of the ingress. It's routing for all host names on that public IP on port 80.
This IP will be the same as the EXTERNAL-IP of the ingress controller, will take a second to update.
If you don't define an ingressclassname and don't have a default ingress class the address won't be updated.

```
kubectl get ingress
kubectl get services --namespace ingress-nginx
```

- Notice the backends are the Service's Endpoints, so the traffic is going straight from the Ingress Controller to the Pod cutting out the kube-proxy hop.
Also notice, the default backend is the same service, that's because we didn't define any rules and we just populated ingress.spec.backend. We're going to look at rules next.

```
kubectl describe ingress ingress-single
```

- Access the application via the exposed ingress on the public IP
```
INGRESSIP=$(kubectl get ingress -o jsonpath='{ .items[].status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip }')
curl http://$INGRESSIP
```

## Multiple Services with path based routing
- Let's create two additional services
```
kubectl create deployment hello-world-service-blue --image=ghcr.io/hungtran84/hello-app:1.0
kubectl create deployment hello-world-service-red  --image=ghcr.io/hungtran84/hello-app:1.0
```

```
kubectl expose deployment hello-world-service-blue --port=4343 --target-port=8080 --type=ClusterIP
kubectl expose deployment hello-world-service-red  --port=4242 --target-port=8080 --type=ClusterIP
```

- Let's create an ingress with paths each routing to different backend services.

```
kubectl apply -f ingress-path.yaml
```

- We now have two, one for all hosts and the other for our defined host with two paths.
The Ingress controller is implementing these ingresses and we're sharing the one public IP, don't proceed until you see the address populated for your ingress

```
kubectl get ingress --watch
```

- We can see the host, the path, and the backends.
```
kubectl describe ingress ingress-path
```

- Our ingress on all hosts is still routing to service single, since we're accessing the URL with an IP and not a domain name or host header.

```
curl http://$INGRESSIP/
```

- Our paths are routing to their correct services, if we specify a host header or use a DNS name to access the ingress. That's how the rule will route the request.

```
curl http://$INGRESSIP/red  --header 'Host: path.example.com'
curl http://$INGRESSIP/blue --header 'Host: path.example.com'
```

- If we don't specify a path we'll get a 404 while specifying a host header. 
We'll need to configure a path and backend for / or define a default backend for the service.

```
curl http://$INGRESSIP/     --header 'Host: path.example.com'
```

- Let's add a backend to the ingress listenting on path.example.com pointing to the single service.

```
kubectl apply -f ingress-path-backend.yaml
```

- We can see the default backend, and in the Rules, the host, the path, and the backends.

```
kubectl describe ingress ingress-path
```

- Now we'll hit the default backend service, single
```
curl http://$INGRESSIP/ --header 'Host: path.example.com'
```

## Name based virtual hosts
- Now, let's route traffic to the services using named based virtual hosts rather than paths, wait for ADDRESS to be populated

```
kubectl apply -f ingress-namebased.yaml
kubectl get ingress --watch
curl http://$INGRESSIP/ --header 'Host: red.example.com'
curl http://$INGRESSIP/ --header 'Host: blue.example.com'
```

## TLS Example
- Generate a certificate
```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/C=VN/ST=HN/L=TNR/O=IT/OU=IT/CN=training.hungtran.net"
```

- Create a secret with the key and the certificate
```
kubectl create secret tls tls-secret --key tls.key --cert tls.crt
```

- Create an ingress using the certificate and key. This uses HTTPS for both / and /red 

```
kubectl apply -f ingress-tls.yaml
```

- Check the status, do we have an IP?
```
kubectl get ingress --watch
```
- Test access to the hostname, we need `--resolve` because we haven't registered the DNS name.
TLS is a layer lower than host headers, so we have to specify the correct DNS name. 

```
curl https://training.hungtran.net:443 --resolve training.hungtran.net:443:$INGRESSIP --insecure --verbose
```

#Clean up from our lab
```
kubectl delete ingresses ingress-path
kubectl delete ingresses ingress-tls
kubectl delete ingresses ingress-namebased
kubectl delete deployment hello-world-service-single
kubectl delete deployment hello-world-service-red
kubectl delete deployment hello-world-service-blue
kubectl delete service hello-world-service-single
kubectl delete service hello-world-service-red
kubectl delete service hello-world-service-blue
kubectl delete secret tls-secret
rm tls.crt
rm tls.key
```

- Delete the ingress, ingress controller and other configuration elements

```
kubectl delete -f deploy.yaml
```
