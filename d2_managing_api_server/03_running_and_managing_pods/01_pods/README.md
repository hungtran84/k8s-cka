## Pods
- Start up kubectl get events --watch and background it.
```
kubectl get events --watch &
```
- Create a pod. We can see the scheduling, container pulling and container starting.
```
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml

0s          Normal    Scheduled                 pod/hello-world-pod   Successfully assigned default/hello-world-pod to node5

0s          Normal    Starting                  node/node2            Starting kubelet.
...
```

- Start a Deployment with 1 replica. We see the deployment created, scaling the replica set and the replica set starting the first pod
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

0s          Normal    ScalingReplicaSet         deployment/hello-world   Scaled up replica set hello-world-6d59dfc665 to 1

```

- Scale a Deployment to 2 replicas. We see the scaling the replica set and the replica set starting the second pod
```
kubectl scale deployment hello-world --replicas=2

0s          Normal    ScalingReplicaSet         deployment/hello-world              Scaled up replica set hello-world-6d59dfc665 to 2 from 1

```

- We start off with the replica set scaling to 1, then  Pod deletion, then the Pod killing the container 
```
kubectl scale deployment hello-world --replicas=1

0s          Normal    ScalingReplicaSet         deployment/hello-world              Scaled down replica set hello-world-6d59dfc665 to 1 from 2

```

- Let's use exec a command inside our container, we can see the GET and POST API requests through the API server to reach the pod.
```
kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

hello-world-pod                1/1     Running   0          43m

kubectl exec -it hello-world-pod -- /bin/sh

```

- Let's look at the running container/pod from the process level on a Node.
```
kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP         NODE    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

hello-world-pod                1/1     Running   0          46m     10.5.4.2   node5   <none>           <none>

# run from node2
[node2 ~]$ ps -aux | grep hello-app
root      2183  0.0  0.0   9100   880 pts/1    S+   11:27   0:00 grep --color=auto hello-app

exit
```

- Now, let's access our Pod's application directly, without a service and also off the Pod network.
```
kubectl port-forward hello-world-pod 80:8080
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:80 -> 8080
ctrl+c
```

| :warning:  To port-forward k8s pod to a priviliged port (TCP/UDP port < 1024) the priviliged access may be required)   |
|-----------------------------------------|

- Let's do it again, but this time with a non-priviledged port
```
kubectl port-forward hello-world-pod 8080:8080 &
```
- We can point curl to localhost, and kubectl port-forward will send the traffic through the API server to the Pod
```
curl http://localhost:8080
Handling connection for 8080
Hello, world!
Version: 1.0.0
hello-world-pod
```
- Kill our port forward session.
```
fg
ctrl+c
```
- Cleanup resources
```
kubectl delete deployment hello-world
kubectl delete pod hello-world-pod
```
- Kill off the kubectl get events
```
fg
ctrl+c
```

## Static pods
- Quickly create a Pod manifest using `kubectl run` with `dry-run` and `-o yaml`. Copy the manifest to the clipboard for next step
```
kubectl run hello-world --image=ghcr.io/hungtran84/hello-app:2.0 --dry-run=client -o yaml --port=8080 
```
- Log into a node.
Find the staticPodPath:
```
[node2 ~]$ cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
authentication:
  anonymous:
    enabled: false

staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
streamingConnectionIdleTimeout: 0s
syncFrequency: 0s

```

- Create a Pod manifest in the `staticPodPath`, paste in the manifest we created above
```
vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/mypod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: hello-world
  name: hello-world
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ghcr.io/hungtran84/hello-app:2.0
    name: hello-world
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

- Log out of node and back onto cp/master node.
Get a listing of pods, the pods name is podname + node name
```
kubectl get pods -o wide

NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP         NODE    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
hello-world-node2   1/1     Running   0          99s   10.5.1.4   node2   <none>           <none>
```
- Try to delete the pod...
```
kubectl delete pod hello-world-node2
```

- It's still there...
```
kubectl get pods

NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-node2   1/1     Running   0          23s
```

- Log into `node2` and remove the static pod manifest on the node
```
[node2 ~]$ rm /etc/kubernetes/manifests/mypod.yaml
```
- Switch back to `node1` - the CP one. 
The pod is now gone.
``` 
kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
```
