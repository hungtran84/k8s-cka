- Start up kubectl get events --watch and background it.

```
kubectl get events --watch &
```


- Create a pod from manifest

```
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

- We've used exec to launch a shell before, but we can use it to launch ANY program inside a container.
Let's use killall to kill the hello-app process inside our container

```
kubectl exec -it hello-world-pod -- /bin/sh 
ps
exit
```

- We still have our kubectl get events running in the background, so we see if re-create the container automatically.

```
kubectl exec -it hello-world-pod -- /usr/bin/killall hello-app
```

- Our restart count increased by 1 after the container needed to be restarted.

```
kubectl get pods
```

- Look at Containers->State, Last State, Reason, Exit Code, Restart Count and Events
This is because the container restart policy is Always by default

```
kubectl describe pod hello-world-pod
```

- Cleanup time

```
kubectl delete pod hello-world-pod
```

- Kill our watch

```
fg
ctrl+c
```

- Remember...we can ask the API server what it knows about an object, in this case our restartPolicy

```
kubectl explain pods.spec.restartPolicy
```

- Create our pods with the restart policy

```
more pod-restart-policy.yaml
kubectl apply -f pod-restart-policy.yaml
```

- Check to ensure both pods are up and running, we can see the restarts is 0

```
kubectl get pods 
```

- Let's kill our apps in both our pods and see how the container restart policy reacts

```
kubectl exec -it hello-world-never-pod -- /usr/bin/killall hello-app
kubectl get pods
```

- Review container state, reason, exit code, ready and contitions Ready, ContainerReady

```
kubectl describe pod hello-world-never-pod
```

- let's use killall to terminate the process inside our container. 

```
kubectl exec -it hello-world-onfailure-pod -- /usr/bin/killall hello-app
```

- We'll see 1 restart on the pod with the OnFailure restart policy.

```
kubectl get pods 
```

- Let's kill our app again, with the same signal.

```
kubectl exec -it hello-world-onfailure-pod -- /usr/bin/killall hello-app
```

- Check its status, which is now Error too...why? The backoff.

```
kubectl get pods 
```

- Let's check the events, we hit the backoff loop. 10 second wait. Then it will restart.
Also check out State and Last State.

```
kubectl describe pod hello-world-onfailure-pod 
```

- Check its status, should be Running...after the Backoff timer expires.

```
kubectl get pods 
```

- Now let's look at our Pod statuses

```
kubectl delete pod hello-world-never-pod
kubectl delete pod hello-world-onfailure-pod
```
