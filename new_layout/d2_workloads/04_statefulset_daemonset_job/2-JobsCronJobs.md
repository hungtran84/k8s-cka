## Demo 1 - Executing tasks with Jobs, check out the file job.yaml

- Ensure you define a restartPolicy, the default of a Pod is Always, which is not compatible with a Job. We'll need OnFailure or Never, let's look at OnFailure

```
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
```

- Follow job status with a watch

```
kubectl get job --watch
```

- Get the list of Pods, status is Completed and Ready is 0/1

```
kubectl get pods
```

- Let's get some more details about the job...labels and selectors, Start Time, Duration and Pod Statuses

```
kubectl describe job hello-world-job
```

- Get the logs from stdout from the Job Pod

```
kubectl get pods -l job-name=hello-world-job 
kubectl logs hello-world-job-cmn2f
```

- Our Job is completed, but it's up to use to delete the Pod or the Job.

```
kubectl delete job hello-world-job
```

- Which will also delete it's Pods

```
kubectl get pods
```



## Demo 2 - Show restartPolicy in action..., check out backoffLimit: 2 and restartPolicy: Never

### We'll want to use Never so our pods aren't deleted after backoffLimit is reached.

```
kubectl apply -f job-failure-OnFailure.yaml
```


- Let's look at the pods, enters a backoffloop after 2 crashes

```
kubectl get pods --watch
```

- The pods aren't deleted so we can troubleshoot here if needed.

```
kubectl get pods 
```

- And the job won't have any completions and it doesn't get deleted

```
kubectl get jobs 
```

- So let's review what the job did...Events, created...then deleted. Pods status, 3 Failed.

```
kubectl describe jobs | more
```

- Clean up this job

```
kubectl delete jobs hello-world-job-fail
kubectl get pods
```


## Demo 3 - Defining a Parallel Job

```
kubectl apply -f ParallelJob.yaml
```

- 10 Pods will run in parallel up until 50 completions

```
kubectl get pods
```



- We can 'watch' the Statuses with watch

```
watch 'kubectl describe job | head -n 11'
```

- We'll get to 50 completions very quickly

```
kubectl get jobs
```

- Let's clean up...

```
kubectl delete job hello-world-job-parallel
```



## Demo 5 - Scheduling tasks with CronJobs

```
kubectl apply -f CronJob.yaml
```

- Quick overview of the job and it's schedule

```
kubectl get cronjobs
```

- But let's look closer...schedule, Concurrency, Suspend,Starting Deadline Seconds, events...there's execution history

```
kubectl describe cronjobs | more 
```

- Get a overview again...

```
kubectl get cronjobs
```

- The pods will stick around, in the event we need their logs or other inforamtion. How long?

```
kubectl get pods --watch
```

- They will stick around for successfulJobsHistoryLimit, which defaults to three

```
kubectl get cronjobs -o yaml
```

- Clean up the job...

```
kubectl delete cronjob hello-world-cron
```

- Deletes all the Pods too...

```
kubectl get pods 
```
