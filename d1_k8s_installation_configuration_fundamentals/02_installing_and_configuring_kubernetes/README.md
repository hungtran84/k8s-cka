# Building your k8s cluster with `kubeadm`

## Create the kubeadm-based cluster

https://training.hungtran.net/kubernetes/lab-setup/create-kubeamd-based-cluster


## Create GKE Cluster

- Set a default compute zone:
```
gcloud config set compute/zone asia-southeast1-c
```

- Enable GKE services in our current project
```
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
Operation "operations/acf.p2-992714546140-656169a8-750c-4e5f-b347-c641af14a3ad" finished successfully.
```

- Tell GKE to create a single zone, 3 node cluster for us. 3 is the default size. We're disabling basic authentication as it's no longer supported after 1.19 in GKE. It will take some time to create a cluster.

```
gcloud container clusters create gke-test --no-enable-basic-auth --disk-size=50GB --num-nodes=2

Default change: VPC-native is the default mode during cluster creation for versions greater than 1.21.0-gke.1500. To create advanced routes based clusters, please pass the `--no-enable-ip-alias` flag
Default change: During creation of nodepools or autoscaling configuration changes for cluster versions greater than 1.24.1-gke.800 a default location policy is applied. For Spot and PVM it defaults to ANY, and for all other VM kinds a BALANCED policy is used. To change the default values use the `--location-policy` flag.
Note: Your Pod address range (`--cluster-ipv4-cidr`) can accommodate at most 1008 node(s).

- Get our credentials for kubectl

- Check out lists of kubectl contexts
```
kubectl config get-contexts

CURRENT   NAME                                             CLUSTER                                          AUTHINFO                                         NAMESPACE

```

- Set our current context to the GKE context, you may need to update this to your cluster context name.
```
kubectl config use-context gke_red-grid-394709_asia-southeast1-c_gke-test
Switched to context "gke_red-grid-394709_asia-southeast1-c_gke-test".
```

- Run a command to communicate with our cluster.
```
kubectl get nodes
NAME                                      STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION

- Delete our GKE cluster
```
gcloud container clusters delete gke-test
```
