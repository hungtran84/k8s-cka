# Updating a Deployment and checking our rollout status

- Let's start off with rolling out v1

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

- Check the status of the deployment

```
kubectl get deployment hello-world
```

- Now let's apply that deployment, run both this and line 18 at the same time.

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.v2.yaml
```

- Let's check the status of that rollout, while the command blocking your deployment is in the Progressing status.

```
kubectl rollout status deployment hello-world
```

- Expect a return code of 0 from kubectl rollout status...that's how we know we're in the Complete status.

```
echo $?
```

Let's walk through the description of the deployment...
Check out Replicas, Conditions and Events OldReplicaSet (will only be populated during a rollout) and NewReplicaSet
Conditions (more information about our objects state):

* Available      True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
* Progressing    True    NewReplicaSetAvailable (when true, deployment is still progressing or complete)

```
kubectl describe deployments hello-world
```

- Both replicasets remain, and that will become very useful shortly when we use a rollback :)

```
kubectl get replicaset
```

- The NewReplicaSet, check out labels, replicas, status and pod-template-hash

```
kubectl describe replicaset <new-rs-id>
```

- The OldReplicaSet, check out labels, replicas, status and pod-template-hash

```
kubectl describe replicaset <old-rs-id>
```
